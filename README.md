# Hi! Welcome to the ecommerce I coded for my Garage Sale while moving out of the country.

So, I'm moving out of my country and therefore selling basically all my furniture. And because I'm very emotional about all my stuff (and also because I'm a bit deranged probably) I decided to code a fully functional ecommerce for it. And I did it in 2 days because I was on a time limit to sell all of my stuff. So yeyy me for a lot of efficent coding (and for going overboard with capital letters). Hope you enjoy navigating the page.
